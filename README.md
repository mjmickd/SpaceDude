    > Guess the word given using the letters provided before Lady Gaga appears 

## How the Game Works 

    - using the provided letters, a word will pop up and you'll be able to guess it. 

    -as you begin clicking letters, wrong answers will result in pieces of Lady Gaga to appear 

    -if you complete the word before 6 tries, you win. If not, Lady Gaga is finalized and you will be prompted that you lost with the correct word displayed. 

    -Once you've completed the game by either winning or losing, you may click the play again button to restart the game over.
