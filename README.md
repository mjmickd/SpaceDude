# Where's the Beef? 
A description of your game. Background info of the game is a nice touch.

Use the letters to guess the word given before Lady Gaga appears.

## How the Game Works 

- every letter that you click is used to spell out a word that is given, 
be sure to guess the word before Lady Gaga appears. 
-Each time you guess a wrong letter a piece of Lady Gaga starts 
to appear on the screen. 
-If you get more than 6 wrong guesses she will appear 
- If you guess before that then you win.
